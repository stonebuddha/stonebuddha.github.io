<h1 id="current-research-directions">Current Research Directions</h1>
<p>I always welcome new collaborators on the following (incomprehensive) list of research topics.
Please contact me if you are interested in working on one of those directions.</p>
<h3 id="resource-aware-programming-languages">Resource Aware Programming Languages</h3>
<p>Resource usage (e.g., time, memory, and energy) of a program is one of the central
subjects of computer science. However, resource usage usually does not play a central
role in programming language theory such as formal semantics, static analysis,
type systems, and program logics. I am generally interested in most resource-analysis
projects, including both verification (e.g., of software implemented in an existing
programming language) and language design (e.g., for easier and more precise resource analysis).
Below is a sample of medium- to long-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource analysis of Rust: Can the fine-grained memory model improve the precision
and efficiency of resource analysis?</li>
<li>Statistical worst-case analysis: Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation has a very
similar problem statement to Worst-Case Analysis (WCA). Can we use the connection to
transfer techniques back and forth?</li>
<li>Foundations of weighted programming: Composition of resource usage can be easily
extended to other kinds of weights. Can we develop a general (computational) theory
for such weighted programming?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, my favored approach is Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)
but I am open to other approaches such as recurrence solving, sized types, ranking functions,
symbolic resource analysis, etc.</p>
<h3 id="programmable-bayesian-inference">Programmable Bayesian Inference</h3>
<p>In contrast to frequentist methods like deep learning, Bayesian learning accounts
for the probability distribution of hypotheses that produce the observed data and thus
naturally quantifies the uncertainty that is present in the learned models.
In addition, Bayesian learning enables the straightforward incorporation of domain
knowledge and generalizes well to unseen data. These advantages of Bayesian learning
are realized by probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) like <a href="https://mc-stan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stan</a> and <a href="http://pyro.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pyro</a>,
which provide an interface that separates model development from various built-in
Bayesian inference algorithms.</p>
<p>The main downside of Bayesian learning is that probabilistic inference is computationally hard
and not even the most advanced inference algorithms work well for all models.
To make probabilistic inference for Bayesian learning feasible for more models and larger data sets,
some PPLs have there forgone the strict separation of modeling and inference by enabling users to customize
specific Bayesian inference algorithms through so-called <strong>programmable inference</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
However, it is all too easy for users to incorrectly program inference in a way that
breaks convergence and leads to unsound learned models. Such a mistake can even go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I am interested in dissipating the tension between soundness and flexibility of
probabilistic inference by applying programming language techniques such as type
systems and static analysis. The vision is that new programming abstractions and
type systems ensure the soundness of programmable inference while static analysis

<h3 id="foundations-of-randomness-in-software-systems">Foundations of Randomness in Software Systems</h3>
<p>Randomness in software systems can show up in two ways: external randomness (e.g.,
uncertainty from the environment) and internal randomness (e.g., randomized algorithms).
As the Kleene algebra becomes an algebraic foundation for verification of non-probabilistic programs,
I am interested in developing an algebraic framework for verification of probabilistic programs.
To this end, we need to formulate an axiom system, prove soundness and completeness,
and develop a decision procedure for the algebra of randomness.</p>
<p>One fundamental difference between non-probabilistic and probabilistic programs
is that an execution of a non-probabilistic program is a <strong>chain</strong>, but an execution
of a probabilistic program is a <strong>tree</strong>.
To see the point, consider that our program model allows nondeterminism.
A non-probabilistic program then corresponds to a collection of possible execution chains,
but a probabilistic program should be interpreted as a collection of <strong>distributions</strong>,
each of which can be encoded as an execution tree, where each rooted path (annotated with
a probability) is a concrete run of the program.</p>
<p>Moreover, quantum programs also exhibit probabilistic behaviors.
It would also be interesting to apply the reasoning framework of randomness to
quantum computation.</p>
<h1 id="other-projects">Other Projects</h1>
<p>I am always open to new directions, including interdisciplinary ones.
Below is a sample of initial ideas that I am interested in exploring in the
short (or medium) term.
The list is not complete, and be aware that most of the thoughts are not
matured at all; in fact, I would expect some of them will quickly lead to
negative results.</p>

  <summary>Library Summarization via Tensor Products</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Library summarization is an effective way to accelerate the
analysis of client code. However, information about the client is unknown
at the library summarization, preventing complete summarization of the library.
A state-of-the-art approach is Conditional Dyck-CFL Reachability Analysis (ConCRA),
which targets graph-reachability-like static analyses and uses hypothetical summaries.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Lal et al.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> proposed a tensor-product principle: Tensor products
with an appropriate detensor operation allow computations to be rearranged in
certain ways; for example, they can be used to delay a multiplication in a chain
of multiplications. This principle may allow us to generalize, in the summarization framework,
Dyck-CFL-reachability-based analyses to algebraic semiring-based analysis.</p>
  </span>

<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>NPA-TP for Non-idempotent Semirings</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Esparza et al. generalized Newton&rsquo;s method to a method for finding
fixed-points of systems of equations over semirings, leading to a new algorithm
to solve interprocedural dataflow analysis.
Reps et al.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> developed NPA-TP, which extended Esparza&rsquo;s framework with an improved
algorithm for solving linear-context-free-language (LCFL) sub-problems.
However, NPA-TP assumes the underlying abstract domain admits an idempotent semiring;
such an assumption rules out interesting analysis domains, especially for numerical
properties, e.g., the reaching probability.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Esparza&rsquo;s original framework does support non-idempotent semirings,
so it would be a good starting point. The NPA-TP framework features tensor products
to solve LCFL sub-problems, and from the perspective of algebras, the principle of
tensor products does not require idempotence.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: Some recent work shows that quantum computation also needs
non-idempotent semirings. Can the idea of NPA-TP be generalized to analyze
quantum programs?</p>

  <summary>Fraction Bounds for Expected Cost Analysis</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Most of current resource-analysis techniques derive linear, polynomial,
or exponential bounds. However, when analyzing probabilistic programs, we often
encounter bounds that involve fractions. For example, the simple loop <code>while (prob(p)) tick(1);</code>
has an expected cost of $\frac{p}{1-p}$, where $p$ is a program variable that denotes
a non-trivial probability.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In many cases, a fraction bound can be expressed as a polynomial
over another polynomial. So it should be possible to extend current template-based
resource-analysis techniques (e.g., AARA) that derive polynomial bounds, by using
a template for the denominator to reduce fraction-bound inference to polynomial-bound
inference.</p>
  </span>

<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>Complicated Probability Manipulation</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: In many programs, the manipulation of probability is very complicated
and even manual analysis of their correctness is difficult. Consider the problem below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We want to verify that at the end of the loop, the probability of the event $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
is exactly $p$.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability-generating_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probability-generating functions</a> provide a succinct
way to describe probability distributions of discrete random variables.
We might try to derive the probability-generating function of a probabilistic program to
reason about the resulting distribution of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: There is a connection between derivatives of the probability-generating function of
a random variable $X$ and the moments of $X$. Can we use the fact to perform moment analysis?</p>
  </span>

<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>Fine-grained Heap Abstraction via Regular Patterns</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Static analysis of heap-manipulation programs often involves
heap sensitivity. In the simplest case, all memory allocations with the same
program location are treated as a single allocation (thus in a context-insensitive way).
Advanced techniques include three-value-logic for shape analysis, $k$-CFA, $m$-CFA, etc.
However, they seem insufficient when we want to analyze recursive programs.
(Imagine that in functional programming, iterating over a list is usually implemented as a
recursive function.)</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: We can treat the set of all call-strings as a language, then
different strategies for handling sensitivity are essentially different ways of
defining equivalence classes on the language. A presumably good proposal is to use
regular patterns to classify equivalence classes.
For example, $(ff)^*$ indicates calling a function $f$ for an even number of times,
$f(ff)^*$ for an odd number.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: In fact, this approach should generalize to all sensitivities that
use call strings. Is it meaningful to develop a general framework with regular-pattern-sensitivity?</p>

<h3 id="formal-semantics">Formal Semantics</h3>
<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>Combination of Continuous Distributions and Nondeterminism-first</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Nondeterminism-first means that we resolve nondeterminism prior to
program inputs when defining denotational semantics. For example, suppose that a
deterministic function has the signature $A \to B$, then a standard resolution of
nondeterminism gives us $A \to \wp(B)$, but nondeterminism-first suggests $\wp(A \to B)$.
Nondeterminism-first can be useful for e.g., compile-time nondeterminism.
A recent study proposed a denotational semantics for probabilistic programs
that combines discrete distributions (on a countable state space) and nondeterminism-first.
However, it remains open if the semantics can be extended to support continuous distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In fact, I do not have any ideas yet.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: What about a computational theory for such a combination?</p>
  </span>
</details>
<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>Combination of Probability and Message-passing Concurrency</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: The common treatment of a probabilistic flip in the semantics
is to &ldquo;split&rdquo; the current program configuration into two, one for the &ldquo;world&rdquo; where
the flip shows heads and the other for tails. When we need to deal with multiple
concurrent processes, such a treatment means a local flip in a process results in
duplicating all other processes. Such a non-local (thus non-compositional) behavior has been shown to be
problematic for proving soundness of formal methods (e.g., type systems, which are usually compositional).</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: The result of a probabilistic flip should remain as local as possible.
I have developed an operational semantics with the desirable locality, but I feel that
a more algebraic representation is better. For example, we might want to rearrange
the operational semantics to reduction rules and congruence rules. Furthermore, we
should prove an equivalence result to the ordinary probabilistic semantics (e.g., Markov chains).</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: I can always imagine that adding nondeterminism causes a lot of troubles.</p>

  <summary>Safe Interaction between Typed Domain Specific Languages</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Consider we have a typed programming language that is suitable for developing
embedded Domain Specific Languages (eDSLs).
Every eDSL can directly use the base type system from the host language, but it can
also have its own advanced domain-specific type system.
Languages such as <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaOCaml</a> have already supported
such a mechanism, but the interaction between the host language and the eDSL,
or maybe even between different eDSLs, is not very convenient yet.
It would be nice to have a simple and safe interaction scheme among eDSLs on
a same host language.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In fact, I do not have any ideas yet.</p>

  <summary>Lightweight Shape Check for Array Programming</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Array programming (or tensor programming) is pervasive nowadays because of machine learning.
Many machine-learning frameworks lack the ability to statically check tensor shapes are always consistent
during program execution. Approaches based on dependent/refinement/indexed types all seem too heavy to
become practical.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In many (really?) cases, when the input of an array program is fixed,
the shapes of all intermediate arrays are also fixed. So we can perform a static shape check
after the input is given, but before we execute the program, by propagating the concrete shape information
from the given input.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: Is it possible to automatically learn the shape-related effects of library functions (e.g., <code>broadcast_tensor</code>)?</p>

  <summary>Interface Synthesis for Database Tables</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: One central function of low-code programming platforms is to
automatically generate usable interface for manipulating database tables.
In an application, the developers might want to customize a specific way to
organize the interface, and they want to reuse the customization across the
application.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: The customization can be thought as a functor that takes a
database-table module as its input and outputs an inference module for that table.
For low-code programming, it would be useful to have a mechanism where
the developers customize a table interactively and the platform automatically
synthesize the code of the customization functor.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: Low-code programming involves many UI-related customization.
Is there a more general principle?</p>
