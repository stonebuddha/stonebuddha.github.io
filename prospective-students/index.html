<details open class="spoiler">
  <summary>Are you recruiting students?</summary>
  <div style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
  <b>Yes</b>!
  I am just getting started and planning to ramp up slowly (one to two PhD student a year).
  I am also looking for self-motivated master and undergraduate students.
  </div>

<details open class="spoiler">
  <summary>
  Do I need to have a <em>specific</em> research background?
  Do I need to know a <em>specific</em> problem to work on?
  </summary>
  <div style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
  The short answer is "<b>no</b>."
  Programming-languages or software-engineering research experience would be a plus but <b>not a requisite</b>.
  It is more important to know what you are interested in and be passionate enough about
  a broad area of problems to spend about four to five years to work on.

<h1 id="current-research-directions">Current Research Directions</h1>
<p>I always welcome new collaborators on the following (incomprehensive) list of research topics.
Please contact me if you are interested in working on one of those directions.</p>
<h3 id="resource-safe-system-programming">Resource-Safe System Programming</h3>
<p>Resource usage (e.g., time, memory, and energy) of a program is one of the central
subjects of computer science. However, resource usage usually does not play a central
role in programming language theory such as formal semantics, static analysis,
type systems, and program logics. I am generally interested in most resource-analysis
projects, including both verification (e.g., of software implemented in an existing
programming language) and language design (e.g., for easier and more precise resource analysis).</p>
<p>Analysis of resource usage becomes increasingly critical for system programming.
The recent success of Rust indicates that modern system programming languages should
focus on static safety guarantees, such as memory safety and thread safety.
There are a lot of programming languages that do provide such guarantees, but
mostly via runtime mechanisms (such as garbage collection), and those mechanisms
result in unsatisfactory performance, especially in system software.
Rust, by proposing a memory-safety type system, reduces runtime resource consumption
and thus achieves high performance.
<strong>The performance of system software does not only involve memory management, though.</strong>
I am interested in proposing a paradigm of <strong>resource-safe programming</strong>, where
resource consumption of programs are statically verified to meet developers&rsquo; expectation,
and the programs do not exhibit multiple kinds of resource-related vulnerabilities,
such as algorithmic complexity attacks and side-channel attacks.
Below is a sample of medium- to long-term projects of resource-safe system programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Resource analysis of Rust</em>: Can the fine-grained memory model improve the precision
and efficiency of resource analysis?</li>
<li><em>Resource analysis of concurrent programs</em>: Rust has limited support for static thread-safety
guarantees, e.g., Rust does not statically rule out deadlocks. Can we incorporate fine-grained
concurrency model in system programming and extend resource analysis to support it?</li>
<li><em>Target-level resource analysis</em>: How can we analyze compiled programs with respect to
low-level resource metrics, e.g., the number of clock cycles? The analysis needs to be hardware-specific
because we need to take cache, pipeline, branch prediction, etc. into consideration.</li>
<li><em>Discovery of resource-related security vulnerabilities</em>: Can we detect algorithmic-complexity-attack
bugs and/or side-channel-attack bugs? In addition, if such bugs exist, can we automatically
synthesize an attacker to trigger the bugs?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, my favored approach is Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)
but I am open to other approaches such as recurrence solving, sized types, ranking functions,
symbolic resource analysis, etc.</p>
<h3 id="programmable-bayesian-inference">Programmable Bayesian Inference</h3>
<p>In contrast to frequentist methods like deep learning, Bayesian learning accounts
for the probability distribution of hypotheses that produce the observed data and thus
naturally quantifies the uncertainty that is present in the learned models.
In addition, Bayesian learning enables the straightforward incorporation of domain
knowledge and generalizes well to unseen data. These advantages of Bayesian learning
are realized by probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) like <a href="https://mc-stan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stan</a> and <a href="http://pyro.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pyro</a>,
which provide an interface that separates model development from various built-in
Bayesian inference algorithms.</p>
<p>The main downside of Bayesian learning is that probabilistic inference is computationally hard
and not even the most advanced inference algorithms work well for all models.
To make probabilistic inference for Bayesian learning feasible for more models and larger data sets,
some PPLs have there forgone the strict separation of modeling and inference by enabling users to customize
specific Bayesian inference algorithms through so-called <strong>programmable inference</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
However, it is all too easy for users to incorrectly program inference in a way that
breaks convergence and leads to unsound learned models. Such a mistake can even go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I am interested in dissipating the tension between soundness and flexibility of
probabilistic inference by applying programming language techniques such as type
systems and static analysis. The vision is that new programming abstractions and
type systems ensure the soundness of programmable inference while static analysis
and program synthesis assist users by automating the customization of inference
with to goal of improving efficiency. Our <a href="/publication/wanghr21b" target="_blank">recent paper</a>
is a concrete demonstration of this research direction.</p>
<h3 id="quantitative-program-analysis">Quantitative Program Analysis</h3>
<p>Randomness in programs can show up in two ways: external randomness (e.g.,
uncertainty from the environment) and internal randomness (e.g., randomized algorithms).
As Kleene algebras become an algebraic foundation for analysis of non-probabilistic programs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
I am interested in developing an algebraic framework for analysis of probabilistic programs.
To this end, we need to formulate an algebraic semantic framework of probabilistic programs,
and develop a generic algorithm to solve program-analysis instances for probabilistic programs.</p>
<p>One fundamental difference between non-probabilistic and probabilistic programs
is that an execution of a non-probabilistic program is a <strong>chain</strong>, but an execution
of a probabilistic program is a <strong>tree</strong>.
To see the point, consider that our program model allows nondeterminism.
A non-probabilistic program then corresponds to a collection of possible execution chains,
but a probabilistic program should be interpreted as a <strong>collection of distributions</strong>,
each of which can be encoded as an execution tree, where each rooted path (annotated with
a probability) is a concrete run of the program.
See our <a href="/publication/wanghr19" target="_blank">MFPS paper</a> for
a more formal presentation based on <em>hyper graphs</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract interpretation is a powerful framework for describing and solving program-analysis
instances.
Researchers have proposed generic solving strategies, such as chaotic iteration, widening, narrowing, etc.
<strong>However, the iterative solving algorithms do not fit into the quantitative nature
of probabilistic programs.</strong>
Suppose we want to analyze a probabilistic loop &ldquo;$\mathbf{while}~(\mathbf{prob}(3/4))~\{ x = x + 1; \}$.&rdquo;
The expected delta of the variable $x$ is the least solution to the equation $r = f(r) \equiv (1/4) \cdot 0+(3/4) \cdot (r+1)$,
and we can analytically solve it directly: $r = 3$.
However, an iterative solving strategy would approach $r$ by a sequence of approximations: $\{ f^i(0) \}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$,
which will not converge in any finite number of iterations.
I am interested in adapting <em>Newtonian Program Analysis</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to the probabilistic setting, with the observation
that Newton&rsquo;s method is more suitable for such a quantitative setting.</p>
<p>Moreover, the proposed algebraic framework of reasoning about probabilistic programs
should, in principle, be also suitable for reasoning about other quantitative properties,
such as <strong>resource consumption</strong>.
It would be interesting be see if this observation leads to a more general quantitative
program analysis framework.
A recent paper by Batz et al. proposed a notion of <em>weighted programming</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, which
further generalizes the quantitative properties.
Applications of the proposed quantitative program analysis framework include
technology transfer between probabilistic analysis and resource analysis; for example,
Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation has a very
similar problem statement to Worst-Case Analysis (WCA), so it would be interesting to
use the observation to build new statistical resource analysis techniques.</p>

Below is a sample of initial ideas that I am interested in exploring in the

negative results.</p>

  <summary>Library Summarization via Tensor Products</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Library summarization is an effective way to accelerate the
analysis of client code. However, information about the client is unknown
at the library summarization, preventing complete summarization of the library.
A state-of-the-art approach is <a href="/publication/tangwx17" target="_blank">Conditional Dyck-CFL Reachability Analysis (ConCRA)</a>,

<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Lal et al.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> proposed a tensor-product principle: Tensor products
with an appropriate detensor operation allow computations to be rearranged in
certain ways; for example, they can be used to delay a multiplication in a chain
of multiplications. This principle may allow us to generalize, in the summarization framework,
Dyck-CFL-reachability-based analyses to algebraic semiring-based analysis.</p>

Reps et al.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> developed NPA-TP, which extended Esparza&rsquo;s framework with an improved
algorithm for solving linear-context-free-language (LCFL) sub-problems.
However, NPA-TP assumes the underlying abstract domain admits an idempotent semiring;
such an assumption rules out interesting analysis domains, especially for numerical
properties, e.g., the reaching probability.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Esparza&rsquo;s original framework does support non-idempotent semirings,
so it would be a good starting point. The NPA-TP framework features tensor products
to solve LCFL sub-problems, and from the perspective of algebras, the principle of
tensor products does not require idempotence.</p>

non-idempotent semirings. Can the idea of NPA-TP be generalized to analyze
quantum programs?</p>

  <summary>Fine-grained Heap Abstraction via Regular Patterns</summary>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Static analysis of heap-manipulation programs often involves
heap sensitivity. In the simplest case, all memory allocations with the same
program location are treated as a single allocation (thus in a context-insensitive way).
Advanced techniques include three-value-logic for shape analysis, $k$-CFA, $m$-CFA<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, etc.
However, they seem insufficient when we want to analyze recursive programs.
(Imagine that in functional programming, iterating over a list is usually implemented as a
recursive function.)</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: We can treat the set of all call-strings as a language, then
different strategies for handling sensitivity are essentially different ways of
defining equivalence classes on the language. A presumably good proposal is to use
regular patterns to classify equivalence classes.
For example, $(ff)^*$ indicates calling a function $f$ for an even number of times,
$f(ff)^*$ for an odd number.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: In fact, this approach should generalize to all sensitivities that
use call strings. Is it meaningful to develop a general framework with regular-pattern-sensitivity?</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: <a href="/publication/wanghr19" target="_blank">Nondeterminism-first</a> means that we resolve nondeterminism prior to
program inputs when defining denotational semantics. For example, suppose that a
deterministic function has the signature $A \to B$, then a standard resolution of
nondeterminism gives us $A \to \wp(B)$, but nondeterminism-first suggests $\wp(A \to B)$.
Nondeterminism-first can be useful for e.g., compile-time nondeterminism.
A recent study proposed a denotational semantics for probabilistic programs
that combines discrete distributions (on a countable state space) and nondeterminism-first.
However, it remains open if the semantics can be extended to support continuous distributions.</p>

  <summary>Combination of Probability and Message-passing Concurrency</summary>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: The common treatment of a probabilistic flip in the semantics
is to &ldquo;split&rdquo; the current program configuration into two, one for the &ldquo;world&rdquo; where
the flip shows heads and the other for tails. When we need to deal with multiple
concurrent processes, such a treatment means a local flip in a process results in
duplicating all other processes. Such a non-local (thus non-compositional) behavior has been shown to be
problematic for proving soundness of formal methods (e.g., type systems, which are usually compositional).</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: The result of a probabilistic flip should remain as local as possible.
We have recently developed <a href="/publication/daswh20" target="_blank">an operational semantics with the desirable locality</a>, but I feel that
a more algebraic representation is better. For example, we might want to rearrange
the operational semantics to reduction rules and congruence rules. Furthermore, we

Every eDSL can directly use the base type system from the host language, but it can
also have its own advanced domain-specific type system.
Languages such as <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaOCaml</a> have already supported

Many machine-learning frameworks lack the ability to statically check tensor shapes are always consistent

<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In many (really?) cases, when the input of an array program is fixed,
the shapes of all intermediate arrays are also fixed. So we can perform a static shape check
after the input is given, but before we execute the program, by propagating the concrete shape information

  <summary>Fraction Bounds for Expected Cost Analysis</summary>
  <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:1.5em;">
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Most of current resource-analysis techniques derive linear, polynomial,
or exponential bounds. However, when analyzing probabilistic programs, we often
encounter bounds that involve fractions. For example, the simple loop <code>while (prob(p)) tick(1);</code>
has an expected cost of $\frac{p}{1-p}$, where $p$ is a program variable that denotes
a non-trivial probability.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: In many cases, a fraction bound can be expressed as a polynomial
over another polynomial. So it should be possible to extend current template-based
resource-analysis techniques (e.g., AARA) that derive polynomial bounds, by using
a template for the denominator to reduce fraction-bound inference to polynomial-bound
inference.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: A random thought: how can we apply such resource-analysis technique

theorems, people have successfully developed techniques for analyzing arithmetic programs.
It would be interesting to see if the whole methodology applies to functional programming,
where we have inductive data structures (that can hold potential) instead of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: One version of optional stopping theorems states that the expected change
in one evaluation step should be &ldquo;bounded.&rdquo; This should intuitively hold for
functional programming (I mean, in most cases) because one step should change the
size of a data structure by at most one (consider the case of <code>cons</code>).
By constructing a suitable Markov chain, we might be able to reason about
probabilistic functional programs with non-monotone resources.</p>
